                    <h2>Lighthouses</h2>
                    <p>
                        A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps 
                        and lenses and to serve as a beacon for navigational aid, for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways.<br>

                        Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, rocks, and safe entries to harbors; they also
                        assist in aerial navigation. Once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the
                        expense of maintenance and has become uneconomical since the advent of much cheaper, more sophisticated and
                        effective electronic navigational systems.

                    <p>
                        Marble Hill is the northernmost neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. 
                        It is one of the few areas within the borough of Manhattan not located on Manhattan Island. 
                        Marble Hill was occupied as a Dutch colonial settlement in 1646, and gained its current name 
                        in 1891 because of marble deposits underneath the neighborhood.

                    <h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
                    <p>Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, 
                        spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States.
                        The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as the Canadian Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries.
                        The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat 
                        Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.

                    <h2>Black Rock Mountain State Park</h2>
                    <p>
                    Black Rock Mountain State Park is a 1,743-acre Georgia, 
                    United States, state park west of Mountain City in Rabun County, 
                    in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is named after its sheer cliffs of 
                    dark-colored biotite gneiss. Astride the Eastern Continental Divide 
                    at an elevation of 3,640 feet, the park provides many scenic 
                    overlooks and 80-mile vistas of the southern Appalachian Mountains. 
                    On a clear day, four states are visible: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
                    and Tennessee. In addition to Black Rock Mountain itself, the park includes four other 
                    peaks over 3,000 feet in elevation, making it the state's highest state park. 
                    As of 2019, it was open to visitors year round.
