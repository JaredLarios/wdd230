                <h2>Guatemala City Central Park</h2>
                <p>
                    The historic center of Guatemala City is the area occupied by the original settlement of 
                    Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción between 1776 and 1892, before the expansion 
                    of the city began towards the four cardinal points, especially towards the South. 
                    The historic center corresponds to the limits of the original layout of the city 
                    (today part of zone 1). The following historic buildings are located there: National Palace of Culture, 
                    Guatemala City Cathedral, Trade Portal, North Hippodrome and Relief Map, Post Office Building and Arch, 
                    Police Palace, Railway Museum, National Theater, Municipality of Guatemala, Parque Jocotenango 
                    (formerly called Parque Morazán), as well as areas such as the Barrio de la Candelaria and the 
                    Civic Center. It was declared "Cultural Heritage in the Guatemalan Nation", according to the agreement 
                    of the Ministry of Culture and Sports (MCD) 328-98 on August 13, 1998.

                <p>
                    The Castle of San Felipe de Lara (Castillo de San Felipe de Lara) (often referred to simply as the Castillo de San Felipe) 
                    is a Spanish colonial fort at the entrance to Lake Izabal in eastern Guatemala. Lake Izabal is connected with the Caribbean 
                    Sea via the Dulce River and El Golfete lake. The fort was strategically situated at the narrowest point on the river. 
                    The Castillo de San Felipe was used by the Spanish for several centuries, during which time it was destroyed and looted 
                    several times by pirates.

                <h2>Pacaya Volcano</h2>
                <p>
                    Pacaya is an active complex volcano in Guatemala, which first erupted approximately 23,000 years ago and has erupted at least 
                    23 times since the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. It rises to an elevation of 2,552 metres (8,373 ft). After being dormant for 
                    over 70 years, it began erupting vigorously in 1961 and has been erupting frequently since then. Much of its activity is 
                    Strombolian, but occasional Plinian eruptions also occur, sometimes showering the area of the nearby Departments with ash.<br><br>

                    Pacaya is a popular tourist attraction. It is even the home to the popular Guatemala Impact Marathon which pioneered the use 
                    of a running route across the lava field created by the 2010 eruption and supports the local communities through runners 
                    endeavouring to complete the challenge. It lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of Guatemala City and close to Antigua. 
                    The volcano sits inside the Escuintla Department.
                    
                    Villagers near Pacaya ignored an evacuation request as the volcano threw ashes into the air in March 2021.</p>

                <h2>Zaculeu Ruins</h2>
                <p>
                    Zaculeu or Saqulew is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site in the highlands of western Guatemala, about 3.7 
                    kilometres (2.3 mi) outside the modern city of Huehuetenango. Occupation at the site dates to the Early Classic period 
                    (AD 250–600) of Mesoamerican history. Zaculeu was the capital of the Postclassic Mam kingdom, and was conquered by the 
                    K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj. It displays a mixture of Mam and K'iche' style architecture.

                    In AD 1525 the city was attacked by Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras during a siege that lasted 
                    several months. Kayb'il B'alam, the city's last ruler, finally surrendered to the Spanish due to starvation.

                <p>
                    Tikal (Tik’al in modern Mayan orthography) is the ruin of an ancient city, which was likely to have been called Yax Mutal, 
                    found in a rainforest in Guatemala. It is one of the largest archeological sites and urban centers of the pre-Columbian Maya 
                    civilization. It is located in the archeological region of the Petén Basin in what is now northern Guatemala. Situated in the 
                    department of El Petén, the site is part of Guatemala's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage 
                    Site.

                <p>
                    The Colonial Art Museum is a museum located in Antigua Guatemala, in the department of Sacatepéquez. This cultural center 
                    was established as such -although under another name- in 1936. It was reopened in 1950, already as a dependency of the Institute of 
                    Anthropology and History. It contains the largest state collection of colonial painting and sculpture in the country (Guatemala 
                    Historical Biographical Dictionary, 2004). The museum stands out in its architecture and is located in front of the ruins of the Cathedral of Antigua Guatemala, 
                    a few meters from the Central Park, on Fifth East Street, number five, in the building that housed the San Carlos de Boromeo
